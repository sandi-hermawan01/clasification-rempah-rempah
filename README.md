### clasification-rempah-rempah
is an artificial intelligence that utilizes computer vision science, as the name implies, what this AI can do is identify spices from Indonesia, to be precise, there are 7 spices that can be predicted such as:
- Andaliman
- Cabe Jawa
- Cengkeh
- Kapulaga
- Kayu Manis
- Lada
- Pala

Tech Stack:
- Python
- Streamlit
- Tensorflow
- Keras Model VGG16

With this AI, it is hoped that we can get to know more about Indonesian spices, but there are some suggestions if you want to develop it further:
- You can make the Andaliman, Clove and Pepper dataset more unique and varied because these spices have many similarities in shape, so AI has difficulty distinguishing them if the dataset is not unique.

How to run:
`pip install streamlit`
navigate to `/clasification-rempah-rempah`
and run `streamlit run app.py`
